Types of Languages
1) Procedural
2) Functional
3) Object Oriented

Procedural
-- Specifies a series of well structured steps and procedures to compose a program.
-- Contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task.

Functional
-- Writing a program only in pure functions i.e) never modify variables, but only create new ones as an ouput.
-- Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ML.
-- First class functions?

Object Oriented
-- Revolves around objects
-- code + Data = Object
-- Developed to make it easier to develop, reuse and maintain software.


Static vs Dynamic Languages
Static
-- Perform type checking at compile time
-- Errors will show at compile time
-- Delare dataType before you use it 
-- More control

Dynamic 
-- Perform type checking at Runtime
-- Errors will might not show till program is run 
-- No need to delare dataType of variables 
-- Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime

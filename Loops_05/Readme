Which loop use in java?

For loop:-
-- If you know how many iterations you want to go for loop (intiliazing vaue, condition, increment or decrement)
-- Most of the times for loop is used.

While loop:-
-- When you need to read the file go for while loop, if the number of iterations is not known.
-- While loop will be used mostly when we want to read a file or read a database. For loop can also be used as a while.
 
Do While Loop:-
-- If you condition get false but you want to exceute the code at least once.
-- It will runs one for sure whether the condition is true or false.
